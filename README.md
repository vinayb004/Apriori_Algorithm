# Apriori_Algorithm
## Introduction
Apriori Algorithm is the classical algorithm which is used in data mining. It is used 
for mining frequent item sets and relevant association rules for those item sets. It is devised to 
operate on a database containing more transactions, for instance, items brought by customers 
in a store.
It is important for effective Market Basket Analysis and it helps the users in purchasing their 
products with more ease which provides more sales in the markets. It has been even used in 
the healthcare industry for the finding of adverse drug reactions. It produces association rules 
that shows what all combinations of medications and patient characteristics lead to ADRs.
## Implementation 
An implementation of Apriori Algorithm to generate Association rules with user input 
values for support and confidence. The support and confidence values are given in decimal 
values. It gives associations rules for different datasets: Amazon, BestBuy, KMART, Nike,Grocery.
High values of support and confidence gives an out of index value. Select a numerical 
value (input) for obtaining the respective data set's association rules. The csv files are uploaded 
too. The screenshots are attached in the file that is submitted. Check the file for report and for 
basic software and hardware used to implement the project. the Project is not software or 
hardware specific.
